## Description
The app is an Express.js API that allows users to connect to a MySQL database using Sequelize. Upon adding their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, the user is able to connect to the database.

The app also allows users to create a development database and seed it with test data by entering schema and seed commands.

When the user enters the command to start the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

Users are able to view data for categories, products, and tags by opening API GET routes in Insomnia Core, and the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

Users are also able to successfully create, update, and delete data in their database by testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core.
